# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

## [2.6] 2025-03-26

### Added

  - Implemented for English, Spanish and German 
  - No print to stdout 
  - No additional fields in the json report 

### Removed 
- CMakeLists: Removed `MSVC_STATIC` flag ([68](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/68))

### Fixed
- Datatables could not contain variables in `Scenario Outlines` ([70](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/70))
- Cells in Datatables can't contain (multiple) variables and text ([71](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/71))

## [2.5] 2024-12-13

### Added 
- `--report-json [optional: file]` to print the test results to json. ([60](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/60))
  - Without file: Json output is on `stdout` 
  - With file: Json output is in file, will override on existing file, does not work on `.feature` files


## [2.4] 2024-11-14

### Added 
- `cwt_cucumber` object for embedding CWT Cucumber and executing tests ([49](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/49))
- `--steps-catalog [optional: file]` to print the implemented steps as readable text to stdout or a given file (this does not write to '.feature' files) ([50](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/50))
- `--steps-catalog-json [optional: file]` to print the implemented steps as json to stdout or a given file (this does not write to '.feature' files) ([50](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/50)) ([54](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/54))
- Custom Parameter Types ([56](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/56))
  - Define custom types with `CUSTOM_PARAMETER(function-name, "{your type}", "regex pattern", "description") { your callback implementation }` 
  - In your callback implement how to consume capture groups
  - Access capture groups with `CUKE_PARAM_ARG(index)`, where index starts at 1 and goes from left to write
- Renamed example target `box` to `example` ([56](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/56))

## [2.3.1] 2024-10-23

### Added 
- Alternative words in steps ([45](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/45))
  - Backslash to toggle between two words (e.g. `is/are` allows `is` and `are` in steps) 
  - Parenthesis to make words or characters optional (e.g. `item(s)` will allow `item` and `items` in steps)


## [2.3.0] 2024-10-23

### Added
- New `CWT_CUCUMBER_STEP_DELAY` environment variable to delay step execution ([32](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/32))
- Expressions `{word}` and `{}` (anonymous) implemented. Note: both are treated as `std::string` ([36](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/36))
- Skip function: `cuke::skip_scenario`. Call This function in the before hook in order to skip a scenario ([37](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/37))

### Fixed
- Tags aren't ineherited correctly, when using tag expression ([35](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/35))
- Integer and floating point types overwrite `{word}` and `{}` in examples table ([40](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/40))

### Changed 
- cuke::value::to_string uses now std::format instead of std::to_string ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Unquotet strings are onlye for anonymous `{}` possible. Every `{string}` value has to use quotes ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Type missmatches (e.g. no quotes on `{string}`) lead to an undefined step ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Stdout print in `Scenario Outline`: Values are within the step. Table prefix removed ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
- Internals: ([42](https://github.com/ThoSe1990/cwt-cucumber/pull/42))
  - Value representation is now a string: the interface in `cuke::value` is replaced with a simple string representation.
  - Step matching: Introduced regex. Each step is converted into a regex pattern
  - Scenario Outline: All steps do a search and replace for their variables.
