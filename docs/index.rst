Coding with Thomas: Cucumber - A C/C++ Cucumber Interpreter
===========================================================

Welcome to CWT-Cucumber! This is the documentation for my C/C++ Cucumber interpreter. Here you can find all information about this project, my motivation, how to use it in your projects and the source code / API documentation.

.. note::
   This is a fun and educational project for me. I am not getting paid for this and I am doing this on my own time, so if there are any problems it will depend on how busy I am to fix them. But I'll always answer as soon as I can.
